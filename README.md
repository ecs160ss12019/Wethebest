# WeTheBest - Space Invaders
[https://github.com/ecs160ss12019/Wethebest](https://github.com/ecs160ss12019/Wethebest)

For this project, we are implementing the classic arcade game, Space Invaders, as an Android application. In Space Invaders, the player controls a cannon that shoots laser beams at approaching waves of aliens. The player must shoot all the aliens to continue onto the next wave. To survive, the player must dodge enemy projectiles and strategically hide behind barriers. If the aliens reach the player or if the player loses all their lives, the player loses.  We expect to complete this project over the course of three one-week sprints.
